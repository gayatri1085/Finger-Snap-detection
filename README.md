This code allows users to control media playback such as spotify, youtube and apple music snapping their fingers,
which the program detects through audio input. When a snap is detected, it sends a command to pause or play the media.

Imports Necessary Libraries

Uses pyaudio for microphone input, numpy for audio processing, and pyautogui to simulate media key presses.
Defines Audio Processing Constants

Sets CHUNK (audio buffer size), FORMAT (32-bit float), CHANNELS (mono), RATE (44.1 kHz), and THRESHOLD (snap detection sensitivity).
Creates a Snap Detection Function

Computes the mean absolute amplitude of the audio signal and compares it to THRESHOLD.
Initializes PyAudio

Creates a PyAudio object to manage audio input.
Opens a Microphone Stream

Captures real-time audio from the microphone with specified settings.
Reads Audio Continuously in a Loop

Converts raw microphone input into a NumPy array for processing.
Detects a Snap Sound

If the computed amplitude exceeds the threshold, it registers as a snap.
Simulates a Play/Pause Keypress

Uses pyautogui.press('playpause') to control media playback.
Prints Feedback on Detection

Displays "Snap detected! Pausing media..." in the console when a snap is registered.
